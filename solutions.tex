This is the first problem.

This is the second paragraph of the first problem. This equation $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos(\theta_C)$ is an example of in-line math.

And this is an example of display mode math:
$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$
This is an example of the align* environment, which can be helpful for mathematical expressions with multiple steps:
\begin{align*}
r &= 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/6 + 1/7 + 1/8 + \ldots + 1/n\\
&< 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 + \ldots + 1/n\\
&= \sum_{i = 1}^{\log n} \frac{2^{i - 1}}{2^i}\\
&= 1/2 \log_2 (n) = O(\log n)
\end{align*}
This is an example of matrices in \LaTeX:
\begin{align*}
	\sigma_x &=
		\begin{pmatrix}
		0 & 1 \\
		1 & 0
		\end{pmatrix} \\
	\sigma_y &=
		\begin{pmatrix}
		0 & -i \\
		i & 0
		\end{pmatrix} \\
	\sigma_z &=
		\begin{pmatrix}
		1 & 0 \\
		0 & -1
		\end{pmatrix} \\
\end{align*}
This concludes the first problem and the mathematical examples. The following questions demonstrate how to use the template for multipart problems.
